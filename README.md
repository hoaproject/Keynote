# Keynote

This repository aggregates all Hoa conferences, presentations, notes etc.

## Quick usage

Some presentations are based on
[DZSlides](https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides/), a bit hacked. You have
different shells to view presentations:

  * `Shells/Embedder.html` to embed slides in a HTML page;
  * `Shells/Mirror.html` is the client for mirrored presentation (useful for
    live);
  * `Shells/Onstage.html` is the dashboard presentation for the speaker (and the
    mirror shell).

Some other presentations are in “static“ HTML files (with no slide, only notes
and images).

Finally, other presentations are in Latex. You will find a `Makefile` to compile
them, even if PDF are normally present.
